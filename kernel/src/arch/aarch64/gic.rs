//! ARM Generic Interrupt Controller (GICv2) Driver
//!
//! The GIC is the standard interrupt controller for ARM Cortex-A processors.
//! It consists of two main components:
//! - Distributor (GICD): Manages interrupt sources and routing
//! - CPU Interface (GICC): Per-CPU interrupt handling
//!
//! The Raspberry Pi 5 uses a GIC (likely GICv2) for interrupt management.
