//! Physical Reality Profiles

//! Build-time selection that defines:
//! - What the kernel may assume (power, memory, latency)
//! - What the kernel must guarantee
//! - What the kernel must forbid
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! Profiles use sealed traits to prevent external implementations, ensuring that

//! # Compile-Time Erasure
//!
//! Profile-inappropriate code paths are completely removed at compile time through:

//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use kernel_bpf::profile::{ActiveProfile, PhysicalProfile};
//!
//! // Stack size is determined at compile time by the active profile
//! const STACK_SIZE: usize = ActiveProfile::MAX_STACK_SIZE;
//!
//! // JIT availability is a compile-time constant
//! if ActiveProfile::JIT_ALLOWED {
//!     // This code is erased in embedded profile

///
/// This trait defines the contract between the kernel and the physical reality
/// it operates in. Each profile specifies:
///
/// - Resource assumptions (memory, power, latency)
/// - Guarantees the kernel must provide
/// - Operations that are forbidden
///
/// # Sealed Trait
///
/// This trait is sealed and cannot be implemented outside this crate.
/// Only `CloudProfile` and `EmbeddedProfile` are valid implementations.
///
/// # Associated Types
///
/// Each profile has associated types that encode its capabilities:
/// - `MemoryStrategy`: How memory is allocated (elastic vs static)
/// - `SchedulerPolicy`: How programs are scheduled (throughput vs deadline)
/// - `FailureSemantic`: How failures are handled (restart vs recovery)
///
/// # Associated Constants
///
/// Constants define hard limits enforced at compile time:
/// - `MAX_STACK_SIZE`: Maximum BPF stack in bytes
/// - `MAX_INSN_COUNT`: Maximum instructions (for WCET in embedded)
/// - `JIT_ALLOWED`: Whether JIT compilation is permitted
/// - `RESTART_ACCEPTABLE`: Whether restart is a valid failure recovery
